# Credits of Chirpanalytica

Welcome to the credit section of the Chirpanalytica AI project.

## Based on the [Jugend hackt](https://jugendhackt.org) project "Profile-O-Mat"

Chirpanalytica originates from the Jugend hackt project "Profile-O-Mat" which was built by [Adrian](https://twitter.com/uberardy), [Levy](https://twitter.com/StoneLabs__), [Bela](https://twitter.com/0xBE7A), [Niklas](https://twitter.com/derNiklaas), [Philipp](https://twitter.com/Sparx_Dev) and [Torben](https://twitter.com/TorbenWetter) with some help by [Paul](https://twitter.com/PauIGoldschmidt).

The data preprocessing function is based on a research project by [Michael](https://twitter.com/mc51_) ([Natural Language Processing of German texts](https://data-dive.com/german-nlp-binary-text-classification-of-reviews-part1)) but has been modified for usage with twitter-text.

Thanks to [Torben Wetter](https://twitter.com/TorbenWetter) for his help during the rebuild of the project.
Also, great thanks to [Martin](https://twitter.com/wikitable) for his help building the [wikidata-query](backend/additional_resources/query.sparql).

This project wouldn't be possible without the help of hundreds and thousands of individuals keeping [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) updated.
